In modern pathology, multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) bring both vast opportunities and challenges. These techniques illuminate complex tumor microenvironment interactions, necessitating intuitive visualization tools. With the rise of electronic health records (EHR) and information overload for physicians, integrating advanced technologies becomes essential. Enter SpatialVisVR: a versatile VR platform for comparing medical images, adaptable for data privacy on embedded hardware. Clinicians can capture pathology slides in real-time via mobile, then SpatialVisVR employs a deep learning algorithm to match and display similar mIF images. This interface allows for adding or removing up to 100 multiplexed protein channels, aiding immuno-oncology decisions. Ultimately, SpatialVisVR aims to refine diagnostic processes, promoting a holistic, efficient approach to immuno-oncology research and treatment.
